# DevTube

This repository contains `Vue.js` frontend and `Express.js` backend for DevTube.

# Why DevTube?

DevTube contains the best `350+` tech talks from different sources – @eduardsi's personal favorites, github lists, YouTube most liked. You can say that DevTube is YouTube uncluttered + some secret gems reuploaded from InfoQ, Vimeo, and private video archives. The talks are updated and contributed regularly thanks to the community.

**💎 Discover hidden gems** – Watch videos that are not publicly available on YouTube (e.g. [Chad Fowler's "Tiny"](https://dev.tube/video/NXSS01n97G0)).

**🕛 Save time** – Watch only the best talks, curated by the community, grouped by categories and speakers. Quality beats quantity.

**🔖 Create lists** – Watch later, bookmark, and keep track of watched videos.

**💬 Discuss** – Read, write, and reply to comments directly from DevTube.

**❤️ Contribute** – Get karma for video contributions. Your name will also be visible next to the video.

**🔔 Subscribe** – Stay up-to-date with the latest videos via RSS. Too busy? Receive one tech talk per week.

**🧘 Fewer distractions** – No annoying YouTube algorithms, irrelevant videos, ads, and tracking.
